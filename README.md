Introduction
The GenAI-FinancialInsights project aims to harness the power of artificial intelligence to simplify financial data interpretation. Through the combination of a financial chatbot and a Jupyter Notebook, users can gain valuable insights from complex financial reports, enabling better decision-making.

Chatbot Overview
The financial chatbot responds to predefined financial queries using canned responses. It handles simple financial queries and provides user-friendly financial insights.

Predefined Queries
What is the total revenue?

How has net income changed over the last year?

What are the total assets?

What are the total liabilities?

What is the cash flow from operating activities?

Example Code
python
predefined_responses = {
    "What is the total revenue?": "The total revenue is $168,088.",
    "How has net income changed over the last year?": "The net income has increased by $10,000 over the last year.",
    "What are the total assets?": "The total assets are $344,607.",
    "What are the total liabilities?": "The total liabilities are $198,304.",
    "What is the cash flow from operating activities?": "The cash flow from operating activities is $89,192."
}

def simple_chatbot(user_query):
    return predefined_responses.get(user_query, "Sorry, I can only provide information on predefined queries.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    user_query = input("Ask a financial question: ")
    response = simple_chatbot(user_query)
    print(response)
Jupyter Notebook Overview
The Jupyter Notebook manipulates and analyzes financial data using pandas.

Example Code
python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import os

# List all files under the input directory
for dirname, _, filenames in os.walk('/kaggle/input'):
    for filename in filenames:
        print(os.path.join(dirname, filename))

# Load the financial data
df = pd.read_csv('/kaggle/input/financialdata/financialdata.csv')

# Calculate revenue growth percentage
df['revenue growth (%)'] = df.groupby(['company'])['totalrevenue'].pct_change() * 100

# Check for missing values
print(df.isna().sum())

# Fill missing values with 0
df.fillna(0, inplace=True)

# Display the DataFrame
print(df)
